This SQL analytic project provides a comprehensive assessment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by analyzing data retrieval and integration techniques, including INNER JOIN, JOIN, UNION, CTEs, VIEW, and various SQL functions. Key objectives include evaluating the overall SDG Index, assessing COVID-19 impacts, conducting regional comparisons, and discussing policy implications. Through meticulous analysis, the project identifies trends such as an upward trajectory in SDG scores and variations across different goals and countries. Notable findings include Finland's consistent high performance and South Sudan's persistent challenges. Moreover, the project suggests policy interventions tailored to specific SDGs, such as free education for SDG 4 and renewable energy promotion for SDG 7. Overall, the project contributes valuable insights into global progress towards sustainable development and informs strategic decision-making for achieving SDGs.
